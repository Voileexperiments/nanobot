I crushed <t> under my bare foot! They were really crunchy!
<t> was really slippery! I tried to grab them, but they ran away, so I just sent Sakamoto to get them :/
<t> tried to escape through the mouse hole, so I put my foot in front of it to stop them! Then it was just easy squishing c:
Woah <t> was tough! I had to put on my boots to crush them!
<t> barely put up a fight, they kept begging so I just squished them quickly to get it over with *shrug*
<t> was really tasty! I should have them with a glass of milk next time, though!
Yuuko told me her feet were tired after school so I let her have <t>, I wonder what she did with them?
<t> was really fun to chase! But I finally pinned them under my sock, sorry :c
I put <t> under a cup for later! Don't worry, though, I promise to squish you soon!
I think Mio said she ran into <t> during field, at least she thought she did, it was kind of hard to tell from their remains :c
Mai said she had something 'unique' planned for <t>, so I let her have them!
Woah! <t> was small enough to fit under my toe, so I just squished them there!
I think I can still feel <t> in my belly!
:flush: Uhm... Let's just say <t> is in somewhere special c:
I tossed <t> around, but I missed and they fell on the floor and broke :c
Run away <t>! The big scary Nano giant is gonna squish you and- *crunch* Whoops!
Uh, I'm kinda tired, let me take a seat... *crunch* Huh...? <t> is that you?
I put on my shoes and completely forgot I left <t> in there, whoops!
I saw Mio giving <t> the squish in the locker room, she looked pretty upset!
Yuuko was upset that she brought <t> to help with her test and they failed, so she crushed them under her boobs!
Whoops! <t> slipped between my boobs! I guess I should just press them together, then!
<t> looked really sad when I told them I was gonna have to squish them, sorry~
