I crushed <t> under my bare foot! They were really crunchy!
<t> was really slippery! I tried to grab them, but they ran away, so I just sent Sakamoto to get them :/
<t> tried to escape through the mouse hole, so I put my foot in front of it to stop them! Then it was just easy squishing c:
Woah <t> was tough! I had to put on my boots to crush them!
<t> barely put up a fight, they kept begging so I just squished them quickly to get it over with *shrug*
<t> was really tasty! I should have them with a glass of milk next time, though!
Yuuko told me her feet were tired after school so I let her have <t>, I wonder what she did with them?
<t> was really fun to chase! But I finally pinned them under my sock, sorry :c
I put <t> under a cup for later! Don't worry, though, I promise to squish you soon!
I think Mio said she ran into <t> during field day, at least she thought she did, it was kind of hard to tell from their remains :c
Mai said she had something 'unique' planned for <t>, so I let her have them!
Woah! <t> was small enough to fit under my toe, so I just squished them there!
I think I can still feel <t> in my belly!
:flushed: Uhm... Let's just say <t> is in somewhere special c:
I tossed <t> around, but I missed and they fell on the floor and broke :c
Run away <t>! The big scary Nano giant is gonna squish you and- *crunch* Whoops!
Uh, I'm kinda tired, let me take a seat... *crunch* Huh...? <t> is that you?
I put on my shoes and completely forgot I left <t> in there, whoops!
I saw Mio giving <t> the squish in the locker room, she looked pretty upset!
Yuuko was upset that she brought <t> to help with her test and they failed, so she crushed them under her boobs!
Whoops! <t> slipped between my boobs! I guess I should just press them together, then!
<t> looked really sad when I told them I was gonna have to squish them, sorry~
Whoops! When I reached down to grab <t> I accidentally smushed their wittle body between my fingers!
Wow! <t> is as small as a bug! They smushed like a bug, too :/
Squish! <t> is still stuck to my foot!
I got really nervous with <t>, they kept wiggling in my fist then they popped!
I thought <t> was a bug scurrying across the table so I just slammed my hand down, I think it got them though!
I don't know what to do with <t> so I think I'll just eat them :/
I didn't know how <t> tasted so I gave them a little lick first, I liked it though! So in my belly you go c:
I think I saw <t> running around the kitchen floor so I just crushed them with my slipper!
Wow! <t> is really slippery! I hope I don't drop them- Whoops!
<t> told me handplay was underrated so I played with them a bit before I crushed them... with my hand!
<t> was kind of annoying, I told him to be quiet but he didn't listen, so I just crushed them instead :c
I felt <t> hanging on my key! That's so embarrassing! I sorta had to crush them after that :/
I hope <t> liked how they went! Right down my throat, I wanted them to survive a bit so I didn't bite!
<t> hung on to my tongue for a bit, that was kinda rude, please don't do that!
<t> really isn't good at balancing on people's noses. They just fell down right into my mouth!
I gave <t> a nice walk around the school! But they really should've held on better... Then they wouldn't be travelling on my shoe's sole.
<t> was so cute, I kept poking at them - but I poked too hard, and now they're squashed!
I wanted to shrink <t> a bit tinier, but I misfired... I think one of my hair strands squished them.
I left <t> in my sock during gym class. I hope they're okay.
<t> got stuck in my sushi, I think they added a lot to the flavor!
