I crushed <t> under my bare foot! They were really crunchy!
<t> was really slippery! I tried to grab them, but they ran away, so I just sent Sakamoto to get them :/
<t> tried to escape through the mouse hole, so I put my foot in front of it to stop them! Then it was just easy squishing c:
Woah <t> was tough! I had to put on my boots to crush them!
<t> barely put up a fight, they kept begging so I just squished them quickly to get it over with *shrug*
<t> was really tasty! I should have them with a glass of milk next time, though!
Yuuko told me her feet were tired after school so I let her have <t>, I wonder what she did with them?
<t> was really fun to chase! But I finally pinned them under my sock, sorry :c
I put <t> under a cup for later! Don't worry, though, I promise to squish you soon!
